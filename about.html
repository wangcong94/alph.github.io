      <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
      <p>Hi my name is Wangcong and this Chess Visualisation Trainer is my first Javascript project.</p>
      <p>
        I love playing chess, but after an 8 game losing streak in online chess I decided enough was enough and picked up a copy of "Modern Chess Openings".
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, I struggled to understand the chess notations in the book. It took me more time to figure out what the notated moves were
        than actually learning about the positions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, I wanted to create a game that would help new players like myself
        become more familiar with chess notations and feel more confident when reading chess books. This is what led me to create the Chess Visualisation Trainer.
      </p>
      <h2><u>About this Project</u></h2>
      <p>
        Knowing nothing about Javascript, I started this project on 22 January 2023 by asking ChatGPT how to style a chessboard in CSS.
      <p>
        ChatGPT and Stack Overflow has continued to helped me tremendously throughout the project, though as the project became more complicated, I found myself having to actually write code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I made the decision to use vanilla CSS and Javascript to build my fundamentals, which turned out to be a decision that I love to hate.
        Nevertheless, I did learn a lot from this project and was quite glad I started it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, 5 weeks later on the 6th of March, I am happy to upload version 1 of the Chess Visualisation Tool.
      </p>
      <h2><u>About Chess Notation</u></h2>
      <p>
        Chess notation is a system of symbols and letters used to record moves
        in a game of chess. It is used to keep track of the moves made by each
        player and to allow players to review and analyse games after they are
        played.
      </p>
      <p>
        In algebraic notation, each square on the chessboard is assigned a unique letter
        and number combination. The letters a-h are used to represent the files (or
        columns) of the board, while the numbers 1-8 are used to represent the ranks (or
        rows) of the board. Thus, the bottom left square of the board is called "a1",
        while the top right square is called "h8".
      </p>
      <p>
        When a piece is moved, its name is followed by the square it is moving to. For
        example, if the white player moves their pawn from e2 to e4, the move would be
        written as "e4". If a piece captures an opponent's piece, an "x" is used to
        indicate the capture. For example, if a white pawn on d5 captures a black pawn
        on c6, the move would be written as "dxc6".
      </p>
      <p>
        For more details on the chess algebraic notation and information on other types of moves such as castling and en passant captures,
        please check out this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)">Wikipedia article</a>.
